Hi, I'm the webmaster of NERDZ!

Wanna know more about this project?
Nerdz is a social network, I think.

I decided to create this site because I'm in love with the informatic world, in fact I'm a web developper, since i was a kid;
The idea was a site dedicated to the persons like me, who love programming,a  place to all the nerdz where you can freely talk about your interests...
This social network is just at the beginning and it needs you to grow up, it needs ACTIVE users and it would be nice if you would help me with spamming it ;)
Anyway, NERDZ is always changing so, if you have any ideas to make the site better you can write me with a private messagge here, I'm always working and waiting for tips!
If you are interested on me and my work,you can find almost everything about me on my nerdz profile: [user]nessuno[/user].
I want to remember that Nerdz, the graphic, the contents, everything is Right Reserved. Under the copyright Â©
and the whole site is (X)HTML 5 Valid and CSS 3 valid.
Well, nothing else... I invite you to register and enjoy my work ;)


Bye ;)",
